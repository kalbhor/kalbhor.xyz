I'm Lakshay Kalbhor, from New Delhi, India. 

I currently reside in Bangalore where I work at [Zerodha Tech](https://zerodha.tech) as a software developer. I mostly use Go & Python at work.

Apart from programming, my hobbies include :
- Basketball 
- 2D fighting games
- Trying out different types of coffee (yes, I'm a certified coffee snob)

My guilty passtime is watching videos on history & geography on Youtube.
