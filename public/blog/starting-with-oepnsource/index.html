    <p>This is in no way going to be a comprehensive guide on how to get started with open source; its going to be more of a description of my journey.</p>
<p><em>This might help you if you’re a beginner struggling to make your way into open source.</em></p>
<h3 id="my-realisationsexperiences-in-a-chronological-order-">My realisations/experiences in a chronological order :</h3>
<h2 id="realisation-1--if-youve-never-contributed-to-a-project-before-its-going-to-be-extremely-difficult-to-contribute-to-someone-elses-code"><strong>Realisation #1 : If you’ve never contributed to a project before, its going to be extremely difficult to contribute to someone else’s code</strong></h2>
<p>I spent weeks trying to find a project that was interesting and easy to contribute to. Sure, I was able to find some issues and fix typos in documentation, but what I really wanted to do was contribute code.</p>
<p><strong>Only after many weeks did the thought of building a project myself came to my mind.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2744/1*J6g2zblKGMENPJuFfpxwLw.png" alt="First few commits"><em>First few commits</em></p>
<h2 id="realisation-2--building-a-project-on-your-own-is-a-good-way-of-jump-starting-some-kind-of-open-source-work">Realisation #2 : Building a project on your own is a good way of jump starting some kind of open source work</h2>
<p>After weeks of toiling hard to find a project, I started building my own project with hopes of learning along the way.</p>
<p>I started building a music downloader and my first few commits were ugly pieces of code that would never get merged into any major project’s code base.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/4004/1*1SvAW17hUcK8Py24J47Kgg.png" alt="I was using C type loops. Ugly python code."><em>I was using C type loops. Ugly python code.</em></p>
<h2 id="realisation-3--if-youre-humble-and-ready-to-learn-random-people-on-the-internet-will-go-miles-to-help-you">Realisation #3 : If you’re humble and ready to learn, random people on the internet will go miles to help you</h2>
<p>After I had roughly built a working version of my music downloader I posted it on various python/programming related subreddits.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see that random people on the internet reviewed my code, told me what was wrong and then provided me with resources to fix things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3916/1*731hoo-Ak--Cz0M9t1xGew.png" alt="Responses on reddit"><em>Responses on reddit</em></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3736/1*lYzOsxePHQLlX_XkKwQvAA.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Few people started sending pull requests and issues which helped me learn how to manage a project.</p>
<p><strong>The end result turned out to be a music downloader that downloaded songs with metadata.</strong></p>
<h2 id="realisation-4--some-problem---write-code-to-solve-it--success--satisfaction">Realisation #4 : (Some problem -&gt; write code to solve it) = Success + Satisfaction</h2>
<p>I soon got bored of my initial project because all it did was download songs and the problem that I now faced was adding metadata to my existing songs.</p>
<p>So I switched to building something similar that made use of some of my previous code.</p>
<p>I started building a tool that would add metadata, album name and other details to existing music files.</p>
<h2 id="realisation-5--knowledge-grows-exponentially">Realisation #5 : Knowledge grows exponentially</h2>
<p>As I started writing more code I realised that I was able to understand and apply concepts faster than before.</p>
<p>Having become accustomed to looking for answers on Google and Stack Overflow, I was no longer afraid of learning new modules and libraries.</p>
<p>During this time I had also started building a few other projects. <strong>I was actively managing 3–4 projects.</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*s1Z9yL8gxgbU_dOMBH1bPg.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="realisation-6--results-show-if-you-keep-at-it">Realisation #6 : Results show if you keep at it</h2>
<p>Remember that second project that I built to add metadata to existing files? I posted it on reddit to receive feedback and turns out people actually liked it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3852/1*Ev2va4uYPVwIdisIOovJzQ.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3648/1*lquqT5f5_pO-_z_6EtnN6g.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The next few weeks went towards fixing issues, managing pull requests and adding features. These weeks turned out to be the most valuable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5280/1*zrc4Jeg8KHdNJjVQe9Qn4A.png" alt="On the trending page"><em>On the trending page</em></p>
<p>The project peeked at 450+ stars on GitHub and even trended on the main page!</p>
<p><strong>I was in no way an expert programmer at this stage, but I was definitely not a beginner anymore.</strong></p>
<p>This success gave me a major boost and I started spending even more time on writing better code.</p>
<h2 id="realisation-7--contributing-to-others-code-doesnt-feel-impossible-now">Realisation #7 : Contributing to other’s code doesn’t feel impossible now</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2556/1*zyzUaUsH_gdpzEg-XQ7oyQ.png" alt="First pull request"><em>First pull request</em></p>
<p>Over the last few months I had built numerous projects and I was surrounded by a lot of code. I started looking for projects that interested me and started fixing issues and adding features.</p>
<p>Turns out the thought process behind contributing to some project was :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hmm, this project seems interesting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Opens issues</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads the code and tries understanding what it does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiddles with code and tries solving a issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2736/1*P8pi4RzW6VXc8C_j4448aw.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These points would make no sense to me 6 months ago because I was looking for a recipe that could give me the power to contribute to open source.</p>
<p>But that’s not how it works.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3116/1*C2JYbwldbfXKWZAFV2I_1w.png" alt="My contributions bar as of now."><em>My contributions bar as of now.</em></p>
<p><strong>Just keep building stuff and show it to people.</strong></p>
<p>It took me more than 6 months to finally settle in and be comfortable with open source.</p>
<p>Even though all this post did was describe my journey, I feel it conveys that it takes time to get a grip on open source and the only way to settle in is by writing a lot of code and building stuff.</p>
<p>I’d like to end with a quote that perfectly describes programming in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The more I learn, the more I realise how much I don’t know.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Albert Einstein</li>
</ul>
